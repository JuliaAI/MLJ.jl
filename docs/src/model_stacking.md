# Model Stacking

In a model stack, as introduced by [Wolpert
(1992)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608005800231),
an adjucating model learns the best way to combine the predictions of
multiple base models. In MLJ, such models are constructed using the
`Stack` constructor. To learn more about stacking and to see how to
construct a stack "by hand" using [Learning Networks](@ref), see [this Data Science in Julia
tutorial](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/getting-started/stacking/)
