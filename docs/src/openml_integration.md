# OpenML Integration

[OpenML](https://www.openml.org) provides an integration platform for
carrying out and comparing machine learning solutions across a broad
collection of public datasets and software platforms. Integration of
MLJ with OpenML is a work in progress.

## Loading IRIS Dataset

As an example, we will try to load the iris dataset using `OpenML.load(taskID)`.

```@setup OpenML
using MLJ.MLJBase
```

## Task ID

`OpenML.load` requires task ID of the the dataset to be loaded. This ID can 
be found on the OpenML website. 
The task ID for the iris dataset is 61, as mentioned in this [OpenML Page](https://www.openml.org/d/61)

```@repl OpenML
rowtable = OpenML.load(61)
```

## Converting to DataFrame

```@repl OpenML
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(rowtable)
df2 = coerce(df, :class=>Multiclass)
```

```@docs
OpenML.load
```
