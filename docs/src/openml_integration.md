# OpenML Integration

The [OpenML platform](https://www.openml.org) provides an integration
platform for carrying out and comparing machine learning solutions
across a broad collection of public datasets and software platforms.

Integration with OpenML API is presently limited to querying and
downloading datasets.

Documentation is [here](https://juliaai.github.io/OpenML.jl/stable/).
