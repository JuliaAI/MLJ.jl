# Logging Workflows

## MLflow integration

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org) is a popular, language-agnostic, tool for externally logging
the outcomes of machine learning experiments, including those carried out using MLJ.

This functionality is provided by the [MLJFlow.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJFlow.jl)
package whose methods are automatically available to MLJ users. Refer to the package's
documentation for examples.
