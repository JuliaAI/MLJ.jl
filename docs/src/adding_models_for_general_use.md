# Adding Models for General Use

This guide outlines in detail the specification of the MLJ model interface and
provides guidelines for implementing the interface for models intended
for general use. For sample implementations, see
[MLJModels/src](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src).

The machine learning tools provided by MLJ can be applied to the
models in any package that imports the package
[MLJBase](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJBase.jl) and
implements the API defined there, as outlined below. For a
quick-and-dirty implementation of user-defined models see [Simple User
Defined Models](simple_user_defined_models.md).  To make new models
available to all MLJ users, see [Where to place code implementing new
models](@ref).

It is assumed the reader has read [Getting Started](index.md).
To implement the API described here, some familiarity with the
following packages is also helpful:

- [ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ScientificTypes.jl)
  (for specifying model requirements of data)

- [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)
  (for probabilistic predictions)

- [CategoricalArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CategoricalArrays.jl)
  (essential if you are implementing a model handling data of
  `Multiclass` or `OrderedFactor` scitype; familiarity with
  `CategoricalPool` objects required)

- [Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) (if your
  algorithm needs input data in a novel format).

In MLJ, the basic interface exposed to the user, built atop the model
interface described here, is the *machine interface*. After a first
reading of this document, the reader may wish to refer to [MLJ
Internals](internals.md) for context.


### Overview

A *model* is an object storing hyperparameters associated with some
machine learning algorithm.  In MLJ, hyperparameters include configuration
parameters, like the number of threads, and special instructions, such
as "compute feature rankings", which may or may not affect the final
learning outcome.  However, the logging level (`verbosity` below) is
excluded.

The name of the Julia type associated with a model indicates the
associated algorithm (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier`). The outcome of
training a learning algorithm is called a *fitresult*. For
ordinary multivariate regression, for example, this would be the
coefficients and intercept. For a general supervised model, it is the
(generally minimal) information needed to make new predictions.

The ultimate supertype of all models is `MLJBase.Model`, which
has two abstract subtypes:

```julia
abstract type Supervised <: Model end
abstract type Unsupervised <: Model end
```

`Supervised` models are further divided according to whether they are
able to furnish probabilistic predictions of the target (which they
will then do by default) or directly predict "point" estimates, for each
new input pattern:

```julia
abstract type Probabilistic <: Supervised end
abstract type Deterministic <: Supervised end
```

Further division of model types is realized through [Trait declarations](@ref).

Associated with every concrete subtype of `Model` there must be a
`fit` method, which implements the associated algorithm to produce the
fitresult. Additionally, every `Supervised` model has a `predict`
method, while `Unsupervised` models must have a `transform`
method. More generally, methods such as these, that are dispatched on
a model instance and a fitresult (plus other data), are called
*operations*. `Probabilistic` supervised models optionally implement a
`predict_mode` operation (in the case of classifiers) or a
`predict_mean` and/or `predict_median` operations (in the case of
regressors) although MLJBase also provides fallbacks that will suffice
in most cases. `Unsupervised` models may implement an
`inverse_transform` operation.


### New model type declarations and optional clean! method

Here is an example of a concrete supervised model type declaration:

```julia
import MLJ

mutable struct RidgeRegressor <: MLJBase.Deterministic
    lambda::Float64
end
```

Models (which are mutable) should not be given internal
constructors. It is recommended that they be given an external lazy
keyword constructor of the same name. This constructor defines default values for
every field, and optionally corrects invalid field values by calling a `clean!` method
(whose fallback returns an empty message string):

```julia
function MLJ.clean!(model::RidgeRegressor)
    warning = ""
    if model.lambda < 0
        warning *= "Need lambda â‰¥ 0. Resetting lambda=0. "
        model.lambda = 0
    end
    return warning
end

# keyword constructor
function RidgeRegressor(; lambda=0.0)
    model = RidgeRegressor(lambda)
    message = MLJBase.clean!(model)
    isempty(message) || @warn message
    return model
end
```


### Supervised models

The compulsory and optional methods to be implemented for each
concrete type `SomeSupervisedModel <: MLJBase.Supervised` are
summarized below. An `=` indicates the return value for a fallback
version of the method.


#### Summary of methods

Compulsory:

```julia
MLJBase.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity::Integer, X, y) -> fitresult, cache, report
MLJBase.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) -> yhat
```

Optional, to check and correct invalid hyperparameter values:

```julia
MLJBase.clean!(model::SomeSupervisedModel) = ""
```

Optional, to return user-friendly form of fitted parameters:

```julia
MLJBase.fitted_params(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult) = fitresult
```

Optional, to avoid redundant calculations when re-fitting machines
associated with a model:

```julia
MLJBase.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y) =
   MLJBase.fit(model, verbosity, X, y)
```

Optional, if `SomeSupervisedModel <: Probabilistic`:

```julia
MLJBase.predict_mode(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    mode.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
MLJBase.predict_mean(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    mean.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
MLJBase.predict_median(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    median.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
```

Required, if the model is to be registered (findable by general users):

```julia
MLJBase.load_path(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel})    = ""
MLJBase.package_name(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "Unknown"
MLJBase.package_uuid(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "Unknown"
```

Strongly recommended, to constrain the form of input data passed to
fit and predict:

```julia
MLJBase.input_scitype(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = Unknown
```

Strongly recommended, to constrain the form of target data passed to fit:

```julia
MLJBase.target_scitype(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = Unknown
```

Optional but recommended:

```julia
MLJBase.package_url(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel})  = "unknown"
MLJBase.is_pure_julia(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = false
MLJBase.package_license(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "unknown"
```


#### The form of data for fitting and predicting

The model implementer does not have absolute control over the types of
data `X`, `y` and `Xnew` appearing in the `fit` and `predict` methods
they must implement. Rather, they can specify the *scientific type* of
this data by making appropriate declarations of the traits
`input_scitype` and `target_scitype` discussed later under [Trait
declarations](@ref).

*Important Note.* Unless it genuinely makes little sense to do so, the
MLJ recommendation is to specify a `Table` scientific type for `X`
(and hence `Xnew`) and an `AbstractVector` scientific type (e.g.,
`AbstractVector{Continuous}`) for targets `y`. Algorithms requiring
matrix input can coerce their inputs appropriately; see below.


##### Additional type coercions

If the core algorithm being wrapped requires data in a different or
more specific form, then `fit` will need to coerce the table into the
form desired (and the same coercions applied to `X` will have to be
repeated for `Xnew` in `predict`). To assist with common cases, MLJ
provides the convenience method
`MLJBase.matrix`. `MLJBase.matrix(Xtable)` has type `Matrix{T}` where
`T` is the tightest common type of elements of `Xtable`, and `Xtable`
is any table. 

Other auxiliary methods provided by MLJBase for handling tabular data
are: `selectrows`, `selectcols`, `select` and `schema` (for extracting
the size, names and eltypes of a table's columns). See [Convenience
methods](@ref) below for details.


##### Important convention

It is to be understood that the columns of the table `X` correspond to
features and the rows to observations. So, for example, the predict
method for a linear regression model might look like `predict(model,
w, Xnew) = MLJBase.matrix(Xnew)*w`, where `w` is the vector of learned
coefficients.


#### The fit method

A compulsory `fit` method returns three objects:

```julia
MLJBase.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity::Int, X, y) -> fitresult, cache, report
```

*Note.* The `Int` typing of `verbosity` cannot be omitted.

1. `fitresult` is the fitresult in the sense above (which becomes an
    argument for `predict` discussed below).

2.  `report` is a (possibly empty) `NamedTuple`, for example,
    `report=(deviance=..., dof_residual=..., stderror=..., vcov=...)`.
    Any training-related statistics, such as internal estimates of the
    generalization error, and feature rankings, should be returned in
    the `report` tuple. How, or if, these are generated should be
    controlled by hyperparameters (the fields of `model`). Fitted
    parameters, such as the coefficients of a linear model, do not go
    in the report as they will be extractable from `fitresult` (and
    accessible to MLJ through the `fitted_params` method described below).

3.	The value of `cache` can be `nothing`, unless one is also defining
    an `update` method (see below). The Julia type of `cache` is not
    presently restricted.

It is not necessary for `fit` to provide type or dimension checks on
`X` or `y` or to call `clean!` on the model; MLJ will carry out such
checks.

The method `fit` should never alter hyperparameter values, the sole
exception being fields of type `<:AbstractRNG`. If the package is able
to suggest better hyperparameters, as a byproduct of training, return
these in the report field.

The `verbosity` level (0 for silent) is for passing to learning
algorithm itself. A `fit` method wrapping such an algorithm should
generally avoid doing any of its own logging.


#### The fitted_params method

A `fitted_params` method may be optionally overloaded. It's purpose is
to provide MLJ access to a user-friendly representation of the
learned parameters of the model (as opposed to the
hyperparameters). They must be extractable from `fitresult`.

```julia
MLJBase.fitted_params(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult) -> friendly_fitresult::NamedTuple
```

For a linear model, for example, one might declare something like
`friendly_fitresult=(coefs=[...], bias=...)`.

The fallback is to return `(fitresult=fitresult,)`.


#### The predict method

A compulsory `predict` method has the form
```julia
MLJBase.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) -> yhat
```

Here `Xnew` will have the same form as the `X` passed to `fit`.

##### Prediction types for deterministic responses.

In the case of `Deterministic` models, `yhat` should have the same
scitype as the `y` passed to `fit` (see above). Any `CategoricalValue`
or `CategoricalString` elements of `yhat` **must have a pool == to the
pool of the target `y` presented in training**, even if not all levels
appear in the training data or prediction itself. For example, in the
case of a univariate target, such as `scitype(y) <:
AbstractVector{Multiclass{3}}`, one requires `MLJ.classes(yhat[i]) ==
MLJ.classes(y[j])` for all admissible `i` and `j`. (The method
`classes` is described under [Convenience methods](@ref) below).

Unfortunately, code not written with the preservation of categorical
levels in mind poses special problems. To help with this, MLJBase
provides three utility methods: `int` (for converting a
`CategoricalValue` or `CategoricalString` into an integer, the
ordering of these integers being consistent with that of the pool),
`decoder` (for constructing a callable object that decodes the
integers back into `CategoricalValue`/`CategoricalString` objects),
and `classes`, for extracting all the `CategoricalValue` or
`CategoricalString` objects sharing the pool of a particular
value/string. Refer to [Convenience methods](@ref) below for important
details.

Note that a decoder created during `fit` may need to be bundled with
`fitresult` to make it available to `predict` during re-encoding. So,
for example, if the core algorithm being wrapped by `fit` expects a
nominal target `yint` of type `Vector{<:Integer}` then a `fit` method
may look something like this:

```julia
function MLJBase.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y)
    yint = MLJBase.int(y)
    a_target_element = y[1]                    # a CategoricalValue/String
    decode = MLJBase.decoder(a_target_element) # can be called on integers

    core_fitresult = SomePackage.fit(X, yint, verbosity=verbosity)

    fitresult = (decode, core_fitresult)
    cache = nothing
    report = nothing
    return fitresult, cache, report
end
```

while a corresponding deterministic `predict` operation might look like this:

```julia
function MLJBase.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew)
    decode, core_fitresult = fitresult
    yhat = SomePackage.predict(core_fitresult, Xnew)
    return decode.(yhat)  # or decode(yhat) also works
end
```

For a concrete example, refer to the
[code](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/ScikitLearn.jl)
for `SVMClassifier`.

Of course, if you are coding a learning algorithm from scratch, rather
than wrapping an existing one, these extra measures may be unnecessary.

##### Prediction types for probabilistic responses

In the case of `Probabilistic` models with univariate targets, `yhat`
must be an `AbstractVector` whose elements are distributions (one distribution
per row of `Xnew`).

Presently, a *distribution* is any object `d` for which
`MLJBase.isdistribution(::d) = true`, which is currently restricted to
objects subtyping `Distributions.Sampleable` from the package
Distributions.jl.

Use the distribution `MLJBase.UnivariateFinite` for `Probabilistic`
models predicting a target with `Finite` scitype (classifiers). In
this case each element of the training target `y` is a
`CategoricalValue` or `CategoricalString`, as in this contrived example:

```julia
using CategoricalArrays
y = Any[categorical([:yes, :no, :no, :maybe, :maybe])...]
```

Note that, as in this case, we cannot assume `y` is a
`CategoricalVector`, and we rely on elements for pool information (if
we need it); this is accessible using the convenience method
`MLJ.classes`:

```julia
julia> yes = y[1]
julia> levels = MLJBase.classes(yes)
3-element Array{CategoricalValue{Symbol,UInt32},1}:
 :maybe
 :no
 :yes
```

Now supposing that, for some new input pattern, the elements `yes =
y[1]` and `no = y[2]` are to be assigned respective probabilities of
0.2 and 0.8. Then the corresponding distribution `d` is constructed as
follows:

```julia
julia> d = MLJBase.UnivariateFinite([yes, no], [0.2, 0.8])
UnivariateFinite(:yes=>0.2, :maybe=>0.0, :no=>0.8)

julia> pdf(d, yes)
0.2

julia> maybe = y[4]; pdf(d, maybe)
0.0
```

Alternatively, a dictionary can be passed to the constructor.

See
[BinaryClassifier](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/GLM.jl)
for an example of a Probabilistic classifier implementation.


```@docs
MLJBase.UnivariateFinite
```

*Important note on binary classifiers.* ScientificTypes.jl has no
"Binary" scitype distinct from `Multiclass{2}` or `OrderedFactor{2}`;
`Binary` is just an alias for
`Union{Multiclass{2},OrderedFactor{2}}`. The `target_scitype` of a
binary classifier will be `AbstractVector{<:Binary}` and according to
the *mlj* scitype convention, elements of `y` have type
`CategoricalValue` or `CategoricalString`, and *not* `Bool`. See
[BinaryClassifier](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/GLM.jl)
for an example.


#### Trait declarations

Two trait functions allow the implementer to restrict the types of
data `X`, `y` and `Xnew` discussed above. The MLJ task interface uses
these traits for data type checks but also for model search. If they
are omitted (and your model is registered) then a general user may
attempt to use your model with inappropriately typed data.

The trait functions `input_scitype` and `target_scitype` take
scientific data types as values. We assume here familiarity with
[ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ScientificTypes.jl)
(see [Getting Started](index.md) for the basics).

For example, to ensure that the `X` presented to the
`DecisionTreeClassifier` `fit` method is a table whose columns all have `Continuous` element type
(and hence `AbstractFloat` machine type), one declares

```julia
MLJBase.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = MLJBase.Table(MLJBase.Continuous)
```

or, equivalently,

```julia
using ScientificTypes
MLJBase.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = Table(Continuous)
```

If, instead, columns were allowed to have either: (i) a mixture of `Continuous` and `Missing`
values, or (ii) `Count` (i.e., integer) values, then the
declaration would be

```julia
MLJBase.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = Table(Union{Continuous,Missing},Count)
```

Similarly, to ensure the target is an AbstractVector whose elements
have `Finite` scitype (and hence `CategoricalValue` or
`CategoricalString` machine type) we declare

```julia
MLJBase.target_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = AbstractVector{<:Finite}
```

##### Multivariate targets

The above remarks continue to hold unchanged for the case multivariate
targets.  For example, if we declare

```julia
target_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel) = AbstractVector{<:Tuple{Continuous,Count}}
```

then each element of `y` will be a tuple of type
`Tuple{AbstractFloat,Integer}`. For predicting variable length
sequences of, say, binary values (`CategoricalValue`s or
`CategoricalString`s with some common size-two pool) we declare

```julia
target_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel) = AbstractVector{<:NTuple{<:Binary}}
```

The trait functions controlling the form of data are summarized as follows:

method                   | return type       | declarable return values     | fallback value
-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------
`input_scitype`          | `Type`            | some scientfic type          | `Unknown`
`target_scitype`         | `Type`            | some scientific type         | `Unknown`


Additional trait functions tell MLJ's `@load` macro how to find your
model if it is registered, and provide other self-explanatory metadata
about the model:

method                   | return type       | declarable return values           | fallback value
-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------
`load_path`              | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_name`           | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_uuid`           | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_url`            | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_license`        | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`is_pure_julia`          | `Bool`            | `true` or `false`                  | `false`

Here is the complete list of trait function declarations for `DecisionTreeClassifier`
([source](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/DecisionTree.jl)):

```julia
MLJBase.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = MLJBase.Table(MLJBase.Continuous)
MLJBase.target_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = AbstractVector{<:MLJBase.Finite}
MLJBase.load_path(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "MLJModels.DecisionTree_.DecisionTreeClassifier"
MLJBase.package_name(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "DecisionTree"
MLJBase.package_uuid(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "7806a523-6efd-50cb-b5f6-3fa6f1930dbb"
MLJBase.package_url(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl"
MLJBase.is_pure_julia(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = true
```
Alternatively these traits can also be declared using `MLJBase.metadata_pkg` and `MLJBase.metadata_model` helper functions as:
```julia
MLJBase.metadata_pkg(DecisionTreeClassifier,name="DecisionTree",
                     uuid="7806a523-6efd-50cb-b5f6-3fa6f1930dbb",
                     url="https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl",
                     julia=true)   
            
MLJBase.metadata_model(DecisionTreeClassifier,
                        input=MLJBase.Table(MLJBase.Continuous),
                        target=AbstractVector{<:MLJBase.Finite},
                        path="MLJModels.DecisionTree_.DecisionTreeClassifier")
 ```
You can test all your declarations of traits by calling `MLJBase.info_dict(SomeModel)`.


#### Iterative models and the update! method

An `update` method may be optionally overloaded to enable a call by
MLJ to retrain a model (on the same training data) to avoid repeating
computations unnecessarily.

```julia
MLJBase.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y) -> fitresult, cache, report
```

If an MLJ `Machine` is being `fit!` and it is not the first time, then
`update` is called instead of `fit`, unless the machine `fit!` has
been called with a new `rows` keyword argument. However, `MLJBase`
defines a fallback for `update` which just calls `fit`. For context,
see [MLJ Internals](internals.md).

Learning networks wrapped as models constitute one use-case (see
[Composing Models](index.md)): one would like each component model to be
retrained only when hyperparameter changes "upstream" make this
necessary. In this case MLJ provides a fallback (specifically, the
fallback is for any subtype of `SupervisedNetwork =
Union{DeterministicNetwork,ProbabilisticNetwork}`). A second more
generally relevant use-case is iterative models, where calls to
increase the number of iterations only restarts the iterative
procedure if other hyperparameters have also changed. For an example,
see the MLJ [ensemble
code](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/src/ensembles.jl).

A third use-case is to avoid repeating time-consuming preprocessing of
`X` and `y` required by some models.

In the event that the argument `fitresult` (returned by a preceding
call to `fit`) is not sufficient for performing an update, the author
can arrange for `fit` to output in its `cache` return value any
additional information required (for example, pre-processed versions
of `X` and `y`), as this is also passed as an argument to the `update`
method.


### Unsupervised models

TODO

This is basically the same but with no target `y` appearing in the
signatures, and no `target_scitype` trait to declare.

### Where to place code implementing new models

Note that different packages can implement models having the same name
without causing conflicts, although an MLJ user cannot simultaneously
*load* two such models.

There are two options for making a new model implementation available
to all MLJ users:

1. **Native implementations** (preferred option). The implementation
   code lives in the same package that contains the learning
   algorithms implementing the interface. In this case, it is
   sufficient to open an issue at
   [MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl)
   requesting the package to be registered with MLJ. Registering a package allows
   the MLJ user to access its models' metadata and to selectively load them.

2. **External implementations** (short-term alternative). The model
   implementation code is necessarily separate from the package
   `SomePkg` defining the learning algorithm being wrapped. In this
   case, the recommended procedure is to include the implementation
   code at
   [MLJModels/src](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src)
   via a pull-request, and test code at
   [MLJModels/test](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/test).
   Assuming `SomePkg` is the only package imported by the
   implementation code, one needs to: (i) register `SomePkg` with
   MLJ as explained above; and (ii) add a corresponding
   `@require` line in the PR to
   [MLJModels/src/MLJModels.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src/MLJModels.jl)
   to enable lazy-loading of that package by MLJ (following the
   pattern of existing additions). If other packages must be imported,
   add them to the MLJModels project file after checking they are not
   already there. If it is really necessary, packages can be also
   added to Project.toml for testing purposes.

Additionally, one needs to ensure that the implementation code defines
the `package_name` and `load_path` model traits appropriately, so that
`MLJ`'s `@load` macro can find the necessary code (see
[MLJModels/src](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src)
for examples). The `@load` command can only be tested after
registration. If changes are made, lodge an new issue at
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ) requesting your
changes to be updated.
