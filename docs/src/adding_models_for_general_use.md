# Adding Models for General Use

!!! note

    Models implementing the MLJ model interface according to the instructions given here should import MLJModelInterface version 1.0.0 or higher. This is enforced with a statement such as `MLJModelInterface = "^1" ` under `[compat]` in the Project.toml file of the package containing the implementation.

This guide outlines the specification of the MLJ model interface
and provides detailed guidelines for implementing the interface for
models intended for general use. See also the more condensed
[Quick-Start Guide to Adding Models](@ref).

For sample implementations, see
[MLJModels/src](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src/builtins).

Interface code can be hosted by the package providing the core machine
learning algorithm, or by a stand-alone "interface-only" package, using
the template
[MLJExampleInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJExampleInterface.jl)
(see [Where to place code implementing new models](@ref) below).

The machine learning tools provided by MLJ can be applied to the
models in any package that imports the package
[MLJModelInterface](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModelInterface.jl) and
implements the API defined there, as outlined below. For a
quick-and-dirty implementation of user-defined models see [Simple User
Defined Models](simple_user_defined_models.md).  To make new models
available to all MLJ users, see [Where to place code implementing new
models](@ref).


#### Important

[MLJModelInterface](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModelInterface.jl)
is a very light-weight interface allowing you to *define* your
interface, but does not provide the functionality required to use or
test your interface; this requires
[MLJBase](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl).  So,
while you only need to add `MLJModelInterface` to your project's
[deps], for testing purposes you need to add
[MLJBase](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl) to your
project's [extras] and [targets]. In testing, simply use `MLJBase` in
place of `MLJModelInterface`.

It is assumed the reader has read [Getting Started](index.md).
To implement the API described here, some familiarity with the
following packages is also helpful:

- [ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/ScientificTypes.jl)
  (for specifying model requirements of data)

- [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)
  (for probabilistic predictions)

- [CategoricalArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CategoricalArrays.jl)
  (essential if you are implementing a model handling data of
  `Multiclass` or `OrderedFactor` scitype; familiarity with
  `CategoricalPool` objects required)

- [Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) (if your
  algorithm needs input data in a novel format).

In MLJ, the basic interface exposed to the user, built atop the model
interface described here, is the *machine interface*. After a first
reading of this document, the reader may wish to refer to [MLJ
Internals](internals.md) for context.


## Overview

A *model* is an object storing hyperparameters associated with some
machine learning algorithm, and that is all. In MLJ, hyperparameters
include configuration parameters, like the number of threads, and
special instructions, such as "compute feature rankings", which may or
may not affect the final learning outcome.  However, the logging level
(`verbosity` below) is excluded. *Learned parameters* (such as the
coefficients in a linear model) have no place in the model struct.

The name of the Julia type associated with a model indicates the
associated algorithm (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier`). The outcome of
training a learning algorithm is called a *fitresult*. For
ordinary multivariate regression, for example, this would be the
coefficients and intercept. For a general supervised model, it is the
(generally minimal) information needed to make new predictions.

The ultimate supertype of all models is `MLJModelInterface.Model`, which
has two abstract subtypes:

```julia
abstract type Supervised <: Model end
abstract type Unsupervised <: Model end
```

`Supervised` models are further divided according to whether they are
able to furnish probabilistic predictions of the target (which they
will then do by default) or directly predict "point" estimates, for each
new input pattern:

```julia
abstract type Probabilistic <: Supervised end
abstract type Deterministic <: Supervised end
```

Further division of model types is realized through [Trait declarations](@ref).

Associated with every concrete subtype of `Model` there must be a
`fit` method, which implements the associated algorithm to produce the
fitresult. Additionally, every `Supervised` model has a `predict`
method, while `Unsupervised` models must have a `transform`
method. More generally, methods such as these, that are dispatched on
a model instance and a fitresult (plus other data), are called
*operations*. `Probabilistic` supervised models optionally implement a
`predict_mode` operation (in the case of classifiers) or a
`predict_mean` and/or `predict_median` operations (in the case of
regressors) although MLJModelInterface also provides fallbacks that will suffice
in most cases. `Unsupervised` models may implement an
`inverse_transform` operation.


## New model type declarations and optional clean! method

Here is an example of a concrete supervised model type declaration,
for a model with a single hyper-parameter:

```julia
import MLJModelInterface
const MMI = MLJModelInterface

mutable struct RidgeRegressor <: MMI.Deterministic
    lambda::Float64
end
```

Models (which are mutable) should not be given internal
constructors. It is recommended that they be given an external lazy
keyword constructor of the same name. This constructor defines default values
for every field, and optionally corrects invalid field values by calling a
`clean!` method (whose fallback returns an empty message string):

```julia
function MMI.clean!(model::RidgeRegressor)
    warning = ""
    if model.lambda < 0
        warning *= "Need lambda â‰¥ 0. Resetting lambda=0. "
        model.lambda = 0
    end
    return warning
end

# keyword constructor
function RidgeRegressor(; lambda=0.0)
    model = RidgeRegressor(lambda)
    message = MMI.clean!(model)
    isempty(message) || @warn message
    return model
end
```

*Important.* The clean method must have the property that
`clean!(clean!(model)) == clean!(model)` for any instance `model`.

Although not essential, try to avoid `Union` types for model
fields. For example, a field declaration `features::Vector{Symbol}`
with a default of `Symbol[]` (detected with `isempty` method) is
preferred to `features::Union{Vector{Symbol}, Nothing}` with a default
of `nothing`.

### Hyper-parameters for parellizatioin options

The section [Acceleration and Parallelism](@ref) indicates how MLJ
models specify an option to run an algorithm using distributed
processing or multi-threading. A hyper-parameter specifying such an
option should be called `acceleration`. Its value `a` should satisfy 
`a isa AbstractResource` where `AbstractResource` is defined in the
ComputationalResources.jl package. An option to run on a GPU is
ordinarily indicated with the `CUDALibs()` resource.

### Hyper-parameter access and mutation

To support hyper-parameter optimization (see [Tuning Models](@ref))
any hyper-parameter to be individually controlled must be:

- property-accessible; nested property access allowed, as in
  `model.detector.K` 
  
- mutable 

For an un-nested hyper-parameter, the requirement is that
`getproperty(model, :param_name)` and `setproperty!(model,
:param_name, value)` have the expected behavior. (In hyper-parameter
tuning, recursive access is implemented using
[`MLJBase.recursive_getproperty`](@ref)` and
[`MLJBase.recursively_setproperty!`](@ref).)

Combining hyper-parameters in a named tuple does not generally
work, because, although property-accessible (with nesting), an
individual value cannot be mutated. 

For a suggested way to deal with hyper-parameters varying in number,
see the
[implementation](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl/blob/dev/src/composition/models/stacking.jl)
of `Stack`, where the model struct stores a varying number of base
models internally as a vector, but components are named at
construction and accessed by overloading `getproperty/setproperty!`
appropriately.

### Macro shortcut

An alternative to declaring the model struct, clean! method and
keyword constructor, is to use the `@mlj_model` macro, as in the
following example:

```julia
@mlj_model mutable struct YourModel <: MMI.Deterministic
    a::Float64 = 0.5::(_ > 0)
    b::String  = "svd"::(_ in ("svd","qr"))
end
```

This declaration specifies:

* A keyword constructor (here `YourModel(; a=..., b=...)`),
* Default values for the hyperparameters,
* Constraints on the hyperparameters where `_` refers to a value
  passed.

For example, `a::Float64 = 0.5::(_ > 0)` indicates that
the field `a` is a `Float64`, takes `0.5` as default value, and
expects its value to be positive.

You cannot use the `@mlj_model` macro if your model struct has type
parameters.

#### Known issue with @mlj_macro

Defaults with negative values can trip up the `@mlj_macro` (see [this
issue](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl/issues/68)). So,
for example, this does not work:

```julia
@mlj_model mutable struct Bar
    a::Int = -1::(_ > -2)
end
```

But this does:

```julia
@mlj_model mutable struct Bar
    a::Int = (-)(1)::(_ > -2)
end
```


## Supervised models

### Mathematical assumptions

At present, MLJ's performance estimate functionality (resampling using
`evaluate`/`evaluate!`) tacitly assumes that feature-label pairs of
observations `(X1, y1), (X2, y2), (X2, y2), ...` are being modelled as
identically independent random variables (i.i.d.), and constructs some
kind of representation of an estimate of the conditional probablility
`p(y | X)` (`y` and `X` single observations). It may be that a model
implementing the MLJ interface has the potential to make predictions
under weaker assumptions (e.g., time series forecasting
models). However the output of the compulsory `predict` method
described below should be the output of the model under the i.i.d
assumption.

In the future newer methods may be introduced to handle weaker
assumptions (see, e.g., [The predict_joint method](@ref) below).


### Summary of methods

The compulsory and optional methods to be implemented for each
concrete type `SomeSupervisedModel <: MMI.Supervised` are
summarized below. 

An `=` indicates the return value for a fallback version of the
method.

Compulsory:

```julia
MMI.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y) -> fitresult, cache, report
MMI.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) -> yhat
```

Optional, to check and correct invalid hyperparameter values:

```julia
MMI.clean!(model::SomeSupervisedModel) = ""
```

Optional, to return user-friendly form of fitted parameters:

```julia
MMI.fitted_params(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult) = fitresult
```

Optional, to avoid redundant calculations when re-fitting machines
associated with a model:

```julia
MMI.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y) =
   MMI.fit(model, verbosity, X, y)
```

Optional, to specify default hyperparameter ranges (for use in tuning):

```julia
MMI.hyperparameter_ranges(T::Type) = Tuple(fill(nothing, length(fieldnames(T))))
```

Optional, if `SomeSupervisedModel <: Probabilistic`:

```julia
MMI.predict_mode(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    mode.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
MMI.predict_mean(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    mean.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
MMI.predict_median(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) =
    median.(predict(model, fitresult, Xnew))
```

Required, if the model is to be registered (findable by general users):

```julia
MMI.load_path(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel})    = ""
MMI.package_name(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "Unknown"
MMI.package_uuid(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "Unknown"
```

```julia
MMI.input_scitype(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = Unknown
```

Strongly recommended, to constrain the form of target data passed to fit:

```julia
MMI.target_scitype(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = Unknown
```

Optional but recommended:

```julia
MMI.package_url(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel})  = "unknown"
MMI.is_pure_julia(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = false
MMI.package_license(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = "unknown"
```

If `SomeSupervisedModel` supports sample weights or class weights,
then instead of the `fit` above, one implements

```julia
MMI.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y, w=nothing) -> fitresult, cache, report
```

and, if appropriate

```julia
MMI.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y, w=nothing) =
   MMI.fit(model, verbosity, X, y, w)
```

Additionally, if `SomeSupervisedModel` supports sample weights, one must declare

```julia
MMI.supports_weights(model::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = true
```

Optionally, an implemenation may add a data front-end, for
transforming user data (such as a table) into some model-specific
format (such as a matrix), and for adding methods to specify how said
format is resampled. (This alters the meaning of `X`, `y` and `w` in
the signatures of `fit`, `update`, `predict`, etc; see [Implementing a
data front-end](@ref) for details). This can provide the MLJ user
certain performance advantages when fitting a machine.

```julia
MLJModelInterface.reformat(model::SomeSupervisedModel, args...) = args
MLJModelInterface.selectrows(model::SomeSupervisedModel, I, data...) = data
```

Optionally, to customized support for serialization of machines (see
[Serialization](@ref)), overload

```julia
MMI.save(filename, model::SomeModel, fitresult; kwargs...) = fitresult
```

and possibly

```julia
MMI.restore(filename, model::SomeModel, serializable_fitresult) -> serializable_fitresult
```

These last two are unlikely to be needed if wrapping pure Julia code.


### The form of data for fitting and predicting

The model implementer does not have absolute control over the types of
data `X`, `y` and `Xnew` appearing in the `fit` and `predict` methods
they must implement. Rather, they can specify the *scientific type* of
this data by making appropriate declarations of the traits
`input_scitype` and `target_scitype` discussed later under [Trait
declarations](@ref).

*Important Note.* Unless it genuinely makes little sense to do so, the
MLJ recommendation is to specify a `Table` scientific type for `X`
(and hence `Xnew`) and an `AbstractVector` scientific type (e.g.,
`AbstractVector{Continuous}`) for targets `y`. Algorithms requiring
matrix input can coerce their inputs appropriately; see below.


#### Additional type coercions

If the core algorithm being wrapped requires data in a different or
more specific form, then `fit` will need to coerce the table into the
form desired (and the same coercions applied to `X` will have to be
repeated for `Xnew` in `predict`). To assist with common cases, MLJ
provides the convenience method
[`MMI.matrix`](@ref). `MMI.matrix(Xtable)` has type `Matrix{T}` where
`T` is the tightest common type of elements of `Xtable`, and `Xtable`
is any table. (If `Xtable` is itself just a wrapped matrix,
`Xtable=Tables.table(A)`, then `A=MMI.table(Xtable)` will be returned
without any copying.)

Alternatively, a more performant option is to implement a data
front-end for your model; see [Implementing a data front-end](@ref).

Other auxiliary methods provided by MLJModelInterface for handling tabular data
are: `selectrows`, `selectcols`, `select` and `schema` (for extracting
the size, names and eltypes of a table's columns). See [Convenience
methods](@ref) below for details.


#### Important convention

It is to be understood that the columns of the table `X` correspond to
features and the rows to observations. So, for example, the predict
method for a linear regression model might look like `predict(model,
w, Xnew) = MMI.matrix(Xnew)*w`, where `w` is the vector of learned
coefficients.


### The fit method

A compulsory `fit` method returns three objects:

```julia
MMI.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y) -> fitresult, cache, report
```

1. `fitresult` is the fitresult in the sense above (which becomes an
    argument for `predict` discussed below).

2.  `report` is a (possibly empty) `NamedTuple`, for example,
    `report=(deviance=..., dof_residual=..., stderror=..., vcov=...)`.
    Any training-related statistics, such as internal estimates of the
    generalization error, and feature rankings, should be returned in
    the `report` tuple. How, or if, these are generated should be
    controlled by hyperparameters (the fields of `model`). Fitted
    parameters, such as the coefficients of a linear model, do not go
    in the report as they will be extractable from `fitresult` (and
    accessible to MLJ through the `fitted_params` method described below).

3.	The value of `cache` can be `nothing`, unless one is also defining
    an `update` method (see below). The Julia type of `cache` is not
    presently restricted.
	
!!! note

    The  `fit` (and `update`) methods should not mutate the `model`. If necessary, `fit` can create a `deepcopy` of `model` first. 


It is not necessary for `fit` to provide type or dimension checks on
`X` or `y` or to call `clean!` on the model; MLJ will carry out such
checks. 

The types of `X` and `y` are constrained by the `input_scitype` and
`target_scitype` trait declarations; see [Trait declarations](@ref)
below. (That is, unless a data front-end is implemented, in which case
these traits refer instead to the arguments of the overloaded
`reformat` method, and the types of `X` and `y` are determined by the
output of `reformat`.)

The method `fit` should never alter hyperparameter values, the sole
exception being fields of type `<:AbstractRNG`. If the package is able
to suggest better hyperparameters, as a byproduct of training, return
these in the report field.

The `verbosity` level (0 for silent) is for passing to learning
algorithm itself. A `fit` method wrapping such an algorithm should
generally avoid doing any of its own logging.

*Sample weight support.* If
`supports_weights(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel})` has been declared
`true`, then one instead implements the following variation on the
above `fit`:

```julia
MMI.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y, w=nothing) -> fitresult, cache, report
```


### The fitted_params method

A `fitted_params` method may be optionally overloaded. It's purpose is
to provide MLJ access to a user-friendly representation of the
learned parameters of the model (as opposed to the
hyperparameters). They must be extractable from `fitresult`.

```julia
MMI.fitted_params(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult) -> friendly_fitresult::NamedTuple
```

For a linear model, for example, one might declare something like
`friendly_fitresult=(coefs=[...], bias=...)`.

The fallback is to return `(fitresult=fitresult,)`.


### The predict method

A compulsory `predict` method has the form

```julia
MMI.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) -> yhat
```

Here `Xnew` will have the same form as the `X` passed to
`fit`. 

Note that while `Xnew` generally consists of multiple observations
(e.g., has multiple rows in the case of a table) it is assumed, in view of
the i.i.d assumption recalled above, that calling `predict(..., Xnew)`
is equivalent to broadcasting some method `predict_one(..., x)` over
the individual observations `x` in `Xnew` (a method implementing the
probablility distribution `p(X |y)` above).


#### Prediction types for deterministic responses.

In the case of `Deterministic` models, `yhat` should have the same
scitype as the `y` passed to `fit` (see above). Any `CategoricalValue`
elements of `yhat` **must have a pool == to the
pool of the target `y` presented in training**, even if not all levels
appear in the training data or prediction itself. For example, in the
case of a univariate target, such as `scitype(y) <:
AbstractVector{Multiclass{3}}`, one requires `MLJ.classes(yhat[i]) ==
MLJ.classes(y[j])` for all admissible `i` and `j`. (The method
`classes` is described under [Convenience methods](@ref) below).

Unfortunately, code not written with the preservation of categorical
levels in mind poses special problems. To help with this,
MLJModelInterface provides three utility methods: `int` (for
converting a `CategoricalValue` into an integer, the ordering of these
integers being consistent with that of the pool), `decoder` (for
constructing a callable object that decodes the integers back into
`CategoricalValue` objects), and `classes`, for extracting all the
`CategoricalValue` objects sharing the pool of a particular
value. Refer to [Convenience methods](@ref) below for important
details.

Note that a decoder created during `fit` may need to be bundled with
`fitresult` to make it available to `predict` during re-encoding. So,
for example, if the core algorithm being wrapped by `fit` expects a
nominal target `yint` of type `Vector{<:Integer}` then a `fit` method
may look something like this:

```julia
function MMI.fit(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, X, y)
    yint = MMI.int(y)
    a_target_element = y[1]                    # a CategoricalValue/String
    decode = MMI.decoder(a_target_element) # can be called on integers

    core_fitresult = SomePackage.fit(X, yint, verbosity=verbosity)

    fitresult = (decode, core_fitresult)
    cache = nothing
    report = nothing
    return fitresult, cache, report
end
```

while a corresponding deterministic `predict` operation might look like this:

```julia
function MMI.predict(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew)
    decode, core_fitresult = fitresult
    yhat = SomePackage.predict(core_fitresult, Xnew)
    return decode.(yhat)  # or decode(yhat) also works
end
```

For a concrete example, refer to the
[code](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/ScikitLearn.jl)
for `SVMClassifier`.

Of course, if you are coding a learning algorithm from scratch, rather
than wrapping an existing one, these extra measures may be unnecessary.


#### Prediction types for probabilistic responses

In the case of `Probabilistic` models with univariate targets, `yhat`
must be an `AbstractVector` whose elements are distributions (one distribution
per row of `Xnew`).

Presently, a *distribution* is any object `d` for which
`MMI.isdistribution(::d) = true`, which is the case for objects of
type `Distributions.Sampleable`.

Use the distribution `MMI.UnivariateFinite` for `Probabilistic` models
predicting a target with `Finite` scitype (classifiers). In this case
the eltype of the training target `y` will be a `CategoricalValue`.

For efficiency, one should not construct `UnivariateDistribution`
instances one at a time. Rather, once a probability vector or matrix
is known, construct an instance of `UnivariateFiniteVector <:
AbstractArray{<:UnivariateFinite},1}` to return. Both `UnivariateFinite`
and `UnivariateFiniteVector` objects are constructed using the single
`UnivariateFinite` function.

For example, suppose the target `y` arrives as a subsample of some
`ybig` and is missing some classes:

```julia
ybig = categorical([:a, :b, :a, :a, :b, :a, :rare, :a, :b])
y = ybig[1:6]
```

Your fit method has bundled the first element of `y` with the
`fitresult` to make it available to `predict` for purposes of tracking
the complete pool of classes. Let's call this `an_element =
y[1]`. Then, supposing the corresponding probabilities of the observed
classes `[:a, :b]` are in an `n x 2` matrix `probs` (where `n` the number of
rows of `Xnew`) then you return

```julia
yhat = UnivariateFinite([:a, :b], probs, pool=an_element)
```

This object automatically assigns zero-probability to the unseen class
`:rare` (i.e., `pdf.(yhat, :rare)` works and returns a zero
vector). If you would like to assign `:rare` non-zero probabilities,
simply add it to the first vector (the *support*) and supply a larger
`probs` matrix.

If instead of raw labels `[:a, :b]` you have the corresponding
`CategoricalElement`s (from, e.g., `filter(cv->cv in unique(y),
classes(y))`) then you can use these instead and drop the `pool`
specifier.

In a binary classification problem it suffices to specify a single
vector of probabilities, provided you specify `augment=true`, as in
the following example, *and note carefully that these probablities are
associated with the* **last** *(second) class you specify in the
constructor:*

```julia
y = categorical([:TRUE, :FALSE, :FALSE, :TRUE, :TRUE])
an_element = y[1]
probs = rand(10)
yhat = UnivariateFinite([:FALSE, :TRUE], probs, augment=true, pool=an_element)
```

The constructor has a lot of options, including passing a dictionary
instead of vectors. See [`UnivariateFinite`](@ref) for details.

See
[LinearBinaryClassifier](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/GLM.jl)
for an example of a Probabilistic classifier implementation.

*Important note on binary classifiers.* There is no "Binary" scitype
distinct from `Multiclass{2}` or `OrderedFactor{2}`; `Binary` is just
an alias for `Union{Multiclass{2},OrderedFactor{2}}`. The
`target_scitype` of a binary classifier will generally be
`AbstractVector{<:Binary}` and according to the *mlj* scitype
convention, elements of `y` have type `CategoricalValue`, and *not*
`Bool`. See
[BinaryClassifier](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/blob/master/src/GLM.jl)
for an example.


### The predict_joint method

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The following API is experimental. It is subject to breaking changes during minor or major releases without warning.
	
```julia
MMI.predict_joint(model::SomeSupervisedModel, fitresult, Xnew) -> yhat
```

Any `Probabilistic` model type `SomeModel`may optionally implement a
`predict_joint` method, which has the same signature as `predict`, but
whose predictions are a single distribution (rather than a vector of
per-observation distributions). 

Specifically, the output `yhat` of `predict_joint` should be an
instance of `Distributions.Sampleable{<:Multivariate,V}`, where
`scitype(V) = target_scitype(SomeModel)` and samples have length `n`,
where `n` is the number of observations in `Xnew`.

If a new model type subtypes `JointProbablistic <: Probabilistic` then
implementation of `predict_joint` is compulsory.


### Trait declarations

Two trait functions allow the implementer to restrict the types of
data `X`, `y` and `Xnew` discussed above. The MLJ task interface uses
these traits for data type checks but also for model search. If they
are omitted (and your model is registered) then a general user may
attempt to use your model with inappropriately typed data.

The trait functions `input_scitype` and `target_scitype` take
scientific data types as values. We assume here familiarity with
[ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/ScientificTypes.jl)
(see [Getting Started](index.md) for the basics).

For example, to ensure that the `X` presented to the
`DecisionTreeClassifier` `fit` method is a table whose columns all
have `Continuous` element type (and hence `AbstractFloat` machine
type), one declares

```julia
MMI.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = MMI.Table(MMI.Continuous)
```

or, equivalently,

```julia
MMI.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = Table(Continuous)
```

If, instead, columns were allowed to have either: (i) a mixture of `Continuous` and `Missing`
values, or (ii) `Count` (i.e., integer) values, then the
declaration would be

```julia
MMI.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = Table(Union{Continuous,Missing},Count)
```

Similarly, to ensure the target is an AbstractVector whose elements
have `Finite` scitype (and hence `CategoricalValue` machine type) we declare

```julia
MMI.target_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = AbstractVector{<:Finite}
```

#### Multivariate targets

The above remarks continue to hold unchanged for the case multivariate
targets.  For example, if we declare

```julia
target_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel) = Table(Continuous)
```

then this constrains the target to be any table whose columns have `Continous` element scitype (i.e., `AbstractFloat`), while

```julia
target_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel) = Table(Continuous, Finite{2})
```

restricts to tables with continuous or binary (ordered or unordered)
columns.

For predicting variable length sequences of, say, binary values
(`CategoricalValue`s) with some common size-two pool) we declare

```julia
target_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel) = AbstractVector{<:NTuple{<:Finite{2}}}
```

The trait functions controlling the form of data are summarized as follows:

method                   | return type       | declarable return values     | fallback value
-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------
`input_scitype`          | `Type`            | some scientfic type          | `Unknown`
`target_scitype`         | `Type`            | some scientific type         | `Unknown`


Additional trait functions tell MLJ's `@load` macro how to find your
model if it is registered, and provide other self-explanatory metadata
about the model:

method                   | return type       | declarable return values           | fallback value
-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------
`load_path`              | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_name`           | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_uuid`           | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_url`            | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`package_license`        | `String`          | unrestricted                       | "unknown"
`is_pure_julia`          | `Bool`            | `true` or `false`                  | `false`
`supports_weights`       | `Bool`            | `true` or `false`                  | `false`

Here is the complete list of trait function declarations for
`DecisionTreeClassifier`, whose core algorithms are provided by
DecisionTree.jl, but whose interface actually lives at
[MLJDecisionTreeInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJDecisionTreeInterface.jl).

```julia
MMI.input_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = MMI.Table(MMI.Continuous)
MMI.target_scitype(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = AbstractVector{<:MMI.Finite}
MMI.load_path(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "MLJDecisionTreeInterface.DecisionTreeClassifier"
MMI.package_name(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "DecisionTree"
MMI.package_uuid(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "7806a523-6efd-50cb-b5f6-3fa6f1930dbb"
MMI.package_url(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = "https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl"
MMI.is_pure_julia(::Type{<:DecisionTreeClassifier}) = true
```

Alternatively these traits can also be declared using `MMI.metadata_pkg` and `MMI.metadata_model` helper functions as:

```julia
MMI.metadata_pkg(DecisionTreeClassifier,name="DecisionTree",
                     packge_uuid="7806a523-6efd-50cb-b5f6-3fa6f1930dbb",
                     package_url="https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl",
                     is_pure_julia=true)

MMI.metadata_model(DecisionTreeClassifier,
                        input_scitype=MMI.Table(MMI.Continuous),
                        target_scitype=AbstractVector{<:MMI.Finite},
                        load_path="MLJDecisionTreeInterface.DecisionTreeClassifier")
```

*Important.* Do not omit the `load_path` specification. If unsure what
it should be, post an issue at
[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/issues).

### Iterative models and the update! method

An `update` method may be optionally overloaded to enable a call by
MLJ to retrain a model (on the same training data) to avoid repeating
computations unnecessarily.

```julia
MMI.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y) -> fit
result, cache, report
MMI.update(model::SomeSupervisedModel, verbosity, old_fitresult, old_cache, X, y, w=nothing) -> fit
result, cache, report
```

Here the second variation applies if `SomeSupervisedModel` supports
sample weights.

If an MLJ `Machine` is being `fit!` and it is not the first time, then
`update` is called instead of `fit`, unless the machine `fit!` has
been called with a new `rows` keyword argument. However, `MLJModelInterface`
defines a fallback for `update` which just calls `fit`. For context,
see [MLJ Internals](internals.md).

Learning networks wrapped as models constitute one use-case (see
[Composing Models](index.md)): one would like each component model to
be retrained only when hyperparameter changes "upstream" make this
necessary. In this case MLJ provides a fallback (specifically, the
fallback is for any subtype of `SupervisedNetwork =
Union{DeterministicNetwork,ProbabilisticNetwork}`). A second more
generally relevant use-case is iterative models, where calls to
increase the number of iterations only restarts the iterative
procedure if other hyperparameters have also changed. (A useful method
for inspecting model changes in such cases is
`MLJModelInterface.is_same_except`. ) For an example, see the MLJ [ensemble
code](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/master/src/ensembles.jl).

A third use-case is to avoid repeating time-consuming preprocessing of
`X` and `y` required by some models.

In the event that the argument `fitresult` (returned by a preceding
call to `fit`) is not sufficient for performing an update, the author
can arrange for `fit` to output in its `cache` return value any
additional information required (for example, pre-processed versions
of `X` and `y`), as this is also passed as an argument to the `update`
method.

### Implementing a data front-end

!!! note

    It is suggested that packages implementing MLJ's model API, that later implement a data front-end, should tag their changes in a breaking release. (The changes will not break use of models for the ordinary MLJ user, who interacts with models exlusively through the machine interface. However, it will break usage for some external packages that have chosen to depend directly on the model API.)

```julia
MLJModelInterface.reformat(model, args...) -> data
MLJModelInterface.selectrows(::Model, I, data...) -> sampled_data
```

Models optionally overload `reformat` to define transformations of
user-supplied data into some model-specific representation (e.g., from
a table to a matrix). Computational overheads associated with multiple
`fit!`/`predict`/`transform` calls (on MLJ machines) are then avoided,
when memory resources allow. The fallback returns `args` (no
transformation). 

The `selectrows(::Model, I, data...)` method is overloaded to specify
how the model-specific data is to be subsampled, for some observation
indices `I` (a colon, `:`, or instance of
`AbstractVector{<:Integer}`). In this way, implementing a data
front-end also allow more efficient resampling of data (in user calls
to `evaluate!`).

After detailing formal requirments for implementing a data front-end,
we give a [Sample implementation](@ref). A simple implementation
[implementation](https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl/blob/94b58faf3042009bd609c9a5155a2e95486c2f0e/src/MLJ.jl#L23)
also appears in the EvoTrees.jl package.

Here "user-supplied data" is what the MLJ user supplies when
constructing a machine, as in `machine(models, args...)`, which
coincides with the arguments expected by `fit(model, verbosity,
args...)` when `reformat` is not overloaded.

Implementing a `reformat` data front-end is permitted for any `Model`
subtype, except for subtypes of `Static`. Here is a complete list of
responsibilities for such an implementation, for some
`model::SomeModelType` (a sample implementation follows after):

- A `reformat(model::SomeModelType, args...) -> data` method must be
  implemented for each form of `args...` appearing in a valid machine
  construction `machine(model, args...)` (there will be one for each
  possible signature of `fit(::SomeModelType, ...)`).

- Additionally, if not included above, there must be a single argument
  form of reformat, `reformat(model::SommeModelType, arg) -> (data,)`,
  serving as a data front-end for operations like `predict`. It must
  always hold that `reformat(model, args...)[1] = reformat(model,
  args[1])`.

*Important.* `reformat(model::SomeModelType, args...)` must always
  return a tuple of the same length as `args`, even if this is one.

- `fit(model::SomeModelType, verbosity, data...)` should be
  implemented as if `data` is the output of `reformat(model,
  args...)`, where `args` is the data an MLJ user has bound to `model`
  in some machine. The same applies to any overloading of `update`.

- Each implemented operation, such as `predict` and `transform` - but
  excluding `inverse_transform` - must be defined as if its data
  arguments are `reformat`ed versions of user-supplied data. For
  example, in the supervised case, `data_new` in
  `predict(model::SomeModelType, fitresult, data_new)` is
  `reformat(model, Xnew)`, where `Xnew` is the data provided by the MLJ
  user in a call `predict(mach, Xnew)` (`mach.model == model`).

- To specify how the model-specific representation of data is to be
  resampled, implement `selectrows(model::SomeModelType, I, data...)
  -> resampled_data` for each overloading of `reformat(model::SomeModel,
  args...) -> data` above. Here `I` is an arbitrary abstract integer
  vector or `:` (type `Colon`).

*Important.* `selectrows(model::SomeModelType, I, args...)` must always
return a tuple of the same length as `args`, even if this is one.

The fallback for `selectrows` is described at [`selectrows`](@ref).


#### Sample implementation

Suppose a supervised model type `SomeSupervised` supports sample
weights, leading to two different `fit` signatures, and that it has a
single operation `predict`:

    fit(model::SomeSupervised, verbosity, X, y)
    fit(model::SomeSupervised, verbosity, X, y, w)

    predict(model::SomeSupervised, fitresult, Xnew)

Without a data front-end implemented, suppose `X` is expected to be a
table and `y` a vector, but suppose the core algorithm always converts
`X` to a matrix with features as rows (features corresponding to
columns in the table).  Then a new data-front end might look like
this:

    constant MMI = MLJModelInterface

    # for fit:
    MMI.reformat(::SomeSupervised, X, y) = (MMI.matrix(X, transpose=true), y)
    MMI.reformat(::SomeSupervised, X, y, w) = (MMI.matrix(X, transpose=true), y, w)
    MMI.selectrows(::SomeSupervised, I, Xmatrix, y) =
        (view(Xmatrix, :, I), view(y, I))
    MMI.selectrows(::SomeSupervised, I, Xmatrix, y, w) =
        (view(Xmatrix, :, I), view(y, I), view(w, I))

    # for predict:
    MMI.reformat(::SomeSupervised, X) = (MMI.matrix(X, transpose=true),)
    MMI.selectrows(::SomeSupervised, I, Xmatrix) = view(Xmatrix, I)

With these additions, `fit` and `predict` are refactored, so that `X`
and `Xnew` represent matrices with features as rows.


### Supervised models with a `transform` method

A supervised model may optionally implement a `transform` method,
whose signature is the same as `predict`. In that case the
implementation should define a value for the `output_scitype` trait. A
declaration

```julia
output_scitype(::Type{<:SomeSupervisedModel}) = T
```

is an assurance that `scitype(transform(model, fitresult, Xnew)) <: T`
always holds, for any `model` of type `SomeSupervisedModel`.

A use-case for a `transform` method for a supervised model is a neural
network that learns *feature embeddings* for categorical input
features as part of overall training. Such a model becomes a
transformer that other supervised models can use to transform the
categorical features (instead of applying the higher-dimensional one-hot
encoding representations).

## Models that learn a probability distribution


!!! warning "Experimental"

    The following API is experimental. It is subject to breaking changes during minor or major releases without warning. Models implementing this interface will not work with MLJBase versions earlier than 0.17.5.

Models that fit a probability distribution to some `data` should be
regarded as `Probablisitic <: Supervised` models with target `y = data`
and `X = nothing`. 

The `predict` method should return a single distribution. 

A working implementation of a model that fits a `UnivariateFinite`
distribution to some categorical data using [Laplace
smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing)
controlled by a hyper-parameter `alpha` is given
[here](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl/blob/d377bee1198ec179a4ade191c11fef583854af4a/test/interface/model_api.jl#L36).


### Serialization 

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The following API is experimental. It is subject to breaking changes during minor or major releases without warning.

The MLJ user can serialize and deserialize a *machine*, which means
serializing/deserializing:

- the associated `Model` object (storing hyperparameters)
- the `fitresult` (learned parameters)
- the `report` generating during training

These are bundled into a single file or `IO` stream specified by the
user using the package `JLSO`. There are two scenarios in which a new
MLJ model API implementation will want to overload two additional
methods `save` and `restore` to support serialization:

1. The algorithm-providing package already has it's own serialization format for learned parameters and/or hyper-parameters, which users may want to access. In that case *the implementation overloads* `save`.
  
2. The `fitresult` is not a sufficiently persistent object; for example, it is a pointer passed from wrapped C code. In that case *the implementation overloads* `save` *and* `restore`.
  
In case 2, 1 presumably applies also, for otherwise MLJ serialization
is probably not going to be possible without changes to the
algorithm-providing package. An example is given below.

Note that in case 1, MLJ will continue to create it's own
self-contained serialization of the machine. Below `filename` refers
to the corresponding serialization file name, as specified by the
user, but with any final extension (e.g., ".jlso", ".gz") removed. If
the user has alternatively specified an `IO` object for serialization,
then `filename` is a randomly generated numeric string.


#### The save method

```julia
MMI.save(filename, model::SomeModel, fitresult; kwargs...) -> serializable_fitresult
```

Implement this method to serialize using a format specific to models
of type `SomeModel`. The `fitresult` is the first return value of
`MMI.fit` for such model types; `kwargs` is a list of keyword
arguments specified by the user and understood to relate to a some
model-specific serialization (cannot be `format=...` or
`compression=...`). The value of `serializable_fitresult` should be a
persistent representation of `fitresult`, from which a correct and
valid `fitresult` can be reconstructed using `restore` (see
below). 

The fallback of `save` performs no action and returns `fitresult`.


#### The restore method

```julia
MMI.restore(filename, model::SomeModel, serializable_fitresult) -> fitresult
```

Implement this method to reconstruct a `fitresult` (as returned by
`MMI.fit`) from a persistent representation constructed using
`MMI.save` as described above. 

The fallback of `restore` returns `serializable_fitresult`.

#### Example

Below is an example drawn from MLJ's XGBoost wrapper. In this example
the `fitresult` returned by `MMI.fit` is a tuple `(booster,
a_target_element)` where `booster` is the `XGBoost.jl` object storing
the learned parameters (essentially a pointer to some object created
by C code) and `a_target_element` is an ordinary `CategoricalValue`
used to track the target classes (a persistent object, requiring no
special treatment).

```julia
function MLJModelInterface.save(filename,
                                ::XGBoostClassifier,
                                fitresult;
                                kwargs...)
    booster, a_target_element = fitresult

    xgb_filename = string(filename, ".xgboost.model")
    XGBoost.save(booster, xgb_filename)
    persistent_booster = read(xgb_filename)
    @info "Additional XGBoost serialization file \"$xgb_filename\" generated. "
    return (persistent_booster, a_target_element)
end

function MLJModelInterface.restore(filename,
                                   ::XGBoostClassifier,
                                   serializable_fitresult)
    persistent_booster, a_target_element = serializable_fitresult

    xgb_filename = string(filename, ".tmp")
    open(xgb_filename, "w") do file
        write(file, persistent_booster)
    end
    booster = XGBoost.Booster(model_file=xgb_filename)
    rm(xgb_filename)
    fitresult = (booster, a_target_element)
    return fitresult
end
```

## Unsupervised models

Unsupervised models implement the MLJ model interface in a very
similar fashion. The main differences are:

- The `fit` method has only one training argument `X`, as in
  `MLJModelInterface.fit(model, verbosity, X)`. However, it has
  the same return value `(fitresult, cache, report)`. An `update`
  method (e.g., for iterative models) can be optionally implemented in
  the same way.

- A `transform` method is compulsory and has the same signature as
  `predict`, as in `MLJModelInterface.transform(model, fitresult, Xnew)`.

- Instead of defining the `target_scitype` trait, one declares an
  `output_scitype` trait (see above for the meaning).

- An `inverse_transform` can be optionally implemented. The signature
  is the same as `transform`, as in
  `MLJModelInterface.inverse_transform(model, fitresult, Xout)`, which:

   - must make sense for any `Xout` for which `scitype(Xout) <:
     output_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel)` (see below); and

   - must return an object `Xin` satisfying `scitype(Xin) <:
     input_scitype(SomeSupervisedModel)`.

- A `predict` method may be optionally implemented, and has the same
  signature as for supervised models, as in
  `MLJModelInterface.predict(model, fitresult, Xnew)`. A use-case is
  clustering algorithms that `predict` labels and `transform` new
  input features into a space of lower-dimension. See [Transformers
  that also predict](@ref) for an example.

### Where to place code implementing new models

Note that different packages can implement models having the same name
without causing conflicts, although an MLJ user cannot simultaneously
*load* two such models.

There are two options for making a new model implementation available
to all MLJ users:

1. **Native implementations** (preferred option). The implementation
   code lives in the same package that contains the learning
   algorithms implementing the interface. An example is
   [`EvoTrees.jl`](https://github.com/Evovest/EvoTrees.jl/blob/master/src/MLJ.jl). In
   this case, it is sufficient to open an issue at
   [MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) requesting
   the package to be registered with MLJ. Registering a package allows
   the MLJ user to access its models' metadata and to selectively load
   them.

2. **Separate interface package**. Implementation code lives in a
   separate *interface package*, which has the algorithm providing
   package as a dependency. See the template repository
   [MLJExampleInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJExampleInterface.jl).

Additionally, one needs to ensure that the implementation code defines
the `package_name` and `load_path` model traits appropriately, so that
`MLJ`'s `@load` macro can find the necessary code (see
[MLJModels/src](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/tree/master/src)
for examples).

### How to add models to the MLJ model registry?

The MLJ model registry is located in the [MLJModels.jl
repository](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl). To
add a model, you need to follow these steps

- Ensure your model conforms to the interface defined above

- Raise an issue at
  [MLJModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl/issues)
  and point out where the MLJ-interface implementation is, e.g. by
  providing a link to the code.

- An administrator will then review your implementation and work with
  you to add the model to the registry
