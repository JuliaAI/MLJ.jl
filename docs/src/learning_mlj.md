# Learning MLJ

The main sources for MLJ tutorials are:

- [Complete list](https://juliaml.ai/tutorials): structured by topic
- [Data Science Tutorials](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl): smaller curated collection of tutorials, generally completed in sequence

If you are an ML practitioner transitioning from another platform, we highly recommend
[MLJ for Data Scientists in Two Hours](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/end-to-end/telco/).
