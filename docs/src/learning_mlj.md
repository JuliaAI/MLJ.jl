# Learning MLJ

[`MLJ Cheatsheet`](@ref)

See also [Getting help and reporting problems](@ref).

The present document, although littered with examples, is primarily
intended as a complete reference. 

**New to machine learning?** Try the "Introduction to Statistical
Learning" notebooks at [Data Science
Tutorials](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/),
starting with [this
tutorial](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/isl/lab-2/).
Or have a look at the [Julia Data
Science](https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience) book.

**Know a little machine learning and just want some MLJ basics?** Read [Getting
Started](@ref).

**A practicing data scientist transitioning from another platform
(e.g., scikit-learn, R)?**: Start with [MLJ for Data Scientists in
Two Hours](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/dev/examples/telco/examples.ipynb).

**Want a compressed survey of key MLJ functionality?**
Try this [Lightning
Tour](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl/blob/dev/examples/lightning_tour/lightning_tour.ipynb).

**Something more leisurely?** See
[MLJTutorial](https://github.com/ablaom/MLJTutorial.jl).

**Prefer a video resource?** Try the slightly older MLJ JuliaCon2020
Workshop
[resources](https://github.com/ablaom/MachineLearningInJulia2020) and
[video
recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&v=qSWbCn170HU&feature=emb_title).

**Looking for more end-to-end examples?** Browse [Data Science
Tutorials](https://juliaai.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl).

**Power MLJ user seeking to wrap complicated workflows?** Learn about [Learning Networks](@ref).
