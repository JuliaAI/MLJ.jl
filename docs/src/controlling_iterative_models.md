# Controlling Iterative Models

Iterative supervised machine learning models are usually trained until
an out-of-sample estimate of the performance satisfies some stopping
criterion, such as `k` consecutive deteriorations of the performance
(see [`Patience`](@ref EarlyStopping.Patience) below). A more
sophisticated kind of control might dynamically mutate parameters,
such as a learning rate, in response to the behavior of these
estimates.

Some iterative model implementations enable some form of automated
control, with the method and options for doing so varying from model
to model. But sometimes it is up to the user to arrange control, which
in the crudest case reduces to manually experimenting with the
iteration parameter.

In response to this ad hoc state of affairs, MLJ provides a uniform
and feature-rich interface for controlling any iterative model that
exposes its iteration parameter as a hyper-parameter, and which
implements the "warm restart" behavior described in [Machines](@ref).


## Basic use

As in [Tuning Models](@ref), iteration control in MLJ is implemented as
a model wrapper, which allows composition with other meta-algorithms.
Ordinarily, the wrapped model behaves just like the original model,
but with the training occurring on a subset of the provided data (to
allow computation of an out-of-sample loss) and with the iteration
parameter automatically determined by the controls specified in the
wrapper.

By setting `retrain=true` one can ask that the wrapped model retrain
on *all* supplied data, after learning the appropriate number of
iterations from the controlled training phase:

```@example gree
using MLJ

X, y = make_moons(100, rng=123, noise=0.5)
EvoTreeClassifier = @load EvoTreeClassifier verbosity=0

iterated_model = IteratedModel(model=EvoTreeClassifier(rng=123, η=0.005),
                               resampling=Holdout(),
                               measures=log_loss,
                               controls=[Step(5),
                                         Patience(2),
                                         NumberLimit(100)],
                               retrain=true)

mach = machine(iterated_model, X, y)
nothing # hide
```

```@repl gree
fit!(mach)
```

As detailed under [`IteratedModel`](@ref MLJIteration.IteratedModel)
below, the specified `controls` are repeatedly applied in sequence to
a *training machine*, constructed under the hood, until one of the
controls triggers a stop. Here `Step(5)` means "Compute 5 more
iterations" (in this case starting from none); `Patience(2)` means
"Stop at the end of the control cycle if there have been 2 consecutive
drops in the log loss"; and `NumberLimit(100)` is a safeguard ensuring
a stop after 100 control cycles (500 iterations). See [Controls
provided](@ref) below for a complete list.

Because iteration is implemented as a wrapper, the "self-iterating"
model can be evaluated using cross-validation, say, and the number of
iterations on each fold will generally be different:

```@example gree
e = evaluate!(mach, resampling=CV(nfolds=3), measure=log_loss, verbosity=0);
map(e.report_per_fold) do r
    r.n_iterations
end
```

Alternatively, one might wrap the self-iterating model in a tuning
strategy, using `TunedModel`; see [Tuning Models](@ref). In this way,
the optimization of some other hyper-parameter is realized
simultaneously with that of the iteration parameter, which will
frequently be more efficient than a direct two-parameter search.


## Controls provided

In the table below, `mach` is the *training machine* being iterated,
constructed by binding the supplied data to the `model` specified in
the `IteratedModel` wrapper, but trained in each iteration on a subset
of the data, according to the value of the `resampling`
hyper-parameter of the wrapper (using all data if `resampling=nothing`).

## Using training losses, and controlling model tuning

Some iterative models report a training loss, as a byproduct of a
`fit!` call, and these can be used in two ways:

1. To supplement an out-of-sample estimate of the loss in deciding when to stop, as in the `PQ` stopping criterion (see [Prechelt, Lutz (1998)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-49430-8_3))); or

2. As a (generally less reliable) substitute for an out-of-sample loss, when wishing to train excusivley on all supplied data.

To have `IteratedModel` bind all data to the training machine and use
training losses in place of an out-of-sample loss, specify
`resampling=nothing`. To check if `MyFavoriteIterativeModel` reports
training losses, load the model code and inspect
`supports_training_losses(MyFavoriteIterativeModel)` (or do
`info("MyFavoriteIterativeModel")`)


### Controlling model tuning

An example of scenario 2 occurs when controlling hyper-parameter
optimization (model tuning). Recall that MLJ's [`TunedModel`](@ref
MLJTuning.TunedModel) wrapper is implemented as an iterative
model. Moreover, this wrapper reports, as a training loss, the lowest
value of the optimization objective function so far (typically the
lowest value of an out-of-sample loss, or -1 times an out-of-sample
score). One may want to simply end the hyper-parameter search when
this value meets the [`NumberSinceBest`](@ref
EarlyStopping.NumberSinceBest) stopping criterion discussed below,
say, rather than introduce an extra layer of resampling to first
"learn" the optimal value of the iteration parameter.

In the following example we conduct a [`RandomSearch`](@ref
MLJTuning.RandomSearch) for the optimal value of the regularization
parameter `lambda` in a `RidgeRegressor` using 6-fold
cross-validation. By wrapping our "self-tuning" version of the
regressor as an [`IteratedModel`](@ref MLJIteration.IteratedModel),
with `resampling=nothing` and `NumberSinceBest(20)` in the controls,
we terminate the search when the number of `lambda` values tested
since the previous best cross-validation loss reaches 20.

```@example gree
using MLJ

X, y = @load_boston;
RidgeRegressor = @load RidgeRegressor pkg=MLJLinearModels verbosity=0
model = RidgeRegressor()
r = range(model, :lambda, lower=-1, upper=2, scale=x->10^x)
self_tuning_model = TunedModel(model=model,
                               tuning=RandomSearch(rng=123),
                               resampling=CV(nfolds=6),
                               range=r,
                               measure=mae);
iterated_model = IteratedModel(model=self_tuning_model,
                               resampling=nothing,
                               control=[Step(1), NumberSinceBest(20), NumberLimit(1000)])
mach = machine(iterated_model, X, y)
nothing # hide
```

```@repl gree
fit!(mach)
```

```@repl gree
report(mach).model_report.best_model
```

We can use `mach` here to directly obtain predictions using the
optimal model (trained on all data), as in

```@repl gree
predict(mach, selectrows(X, 1:4))
```


## Custom controls

Under the hood, control in MLJIteration is implemented using
[IterationControl.jl](https://github.com/ablaom/IterationControl.jl). Rather
than iterating a training machine directly, we iterate a wrapped
version of this object, which includes other information that controls
may want to access, such the MLJ evaluation object. This information
is summarized under [The training machine wrapper](@ref) below.

Controls must implement two `update!` methods, one for initializing
the control's *state* on the first application of the control (this
state being external to the control `struct`) and one for all
subsequent control applications, which generally updates state
also. There are two optional methods: `done`, for specifying
conditions triggering a stop, and `takedown` for specifying actions to
perform at the end of controlled training.

We summarize the training algorithm, as it relates to controls, after
giving a simple example.


### Example 1 - Non-uniform iteration steps

Below we define a control, `IterateFromList(list)`, to train, on each
application of the control, until the iteration count reaches the next
value in a user-specified `list`, triggering a stop when the `list` is
exhausted. For example, to train on iteration counts on a log scale,
one might use `IterateFromList([round(Int, 10^x) for x in range(1, 2,
length=10)]`.

In the code, `wrapper` is an object that wraps the training machine
(see above). The variable `n` is a counter for control cycles (unused
in this example).

```julia

import IterationControl # or MLJ.IterationControl

struct IterateFromList
    list::Vector{<:Int} # list of iteration parameter values
    IterateFromList(v) = new(unique(sort(v)))
end

function IterationControl.update!(control::IterateFromList, wrapper, verbosity, n)
    Δi = control.list[1]
    verbosity > 1 && @info "Training $Δi more iterations. "
    MLJIteration.train!(wrapper, Δi) # trains the training machine
    return (index = 2, )
end

function IterationControl.update!(control::IterateFromList, wrapper, verbosity, n, state)
    index = state.positioin_in_list
    Δi = control.list[i] - wrapper.n_iterations
    verbosity > 1 && @info "Training $Δi more iterations. "
    MLJIteration.train!(wrapper, Δi)
    return (index = index + 1, )
end
```

The first `update` method will be called the first time the control is
applied, returning an initialized `state = (index = 2,)`, which is
passed to the second `update` method, which is called on subsequent
control applications (and which returns the updated `state`).

A `done` method articulates the criterion for stopping:

```julia
IterationControl.done(control::IterateFromList, state) =
    state.index > length(control.list)
```

For the sake of illustration, we'll implement a `takedown` method; its
return value is included in the `IteratedModel` report:

```julia
IterationControl.takedown(control::IterateFromList, verbosity, state)
    verbosity > 1 && = @info "Stepped through these values of the "*
                              "iteration parameter: $(control.list)"
    return (iteration_values=control.list, )
end
```


### The training machine wrapper

A training machine `wrapper` has these properties:

- `wrapper.machine` - the training machine, type `Machine`

- `wrapper.model`   - the mutable atomic model, coinciding with `wrapper.machine.model`

- `wrapper.n_cycles` - the number `IterationControl.train!(wrapper, _)` calls
  so far; generally the current control cycle count

- `wrapper.n_iterations` - the total number of iterations applied to the model so far

- `wrapper.Δiterations` - the number of iterations applied in the last
  `IterationControl.train!(wrapper, _)` call

- `wrapper.loss` - the out-of-sample loss (based on the first measure in `measures`)

- `wrapper.training_losses` - the last batch of training losses (if
  reported by `model`), an abstract vector of length
  `wrapper.Δiteration`.

- `wrapper.evaluation` - the complete MLJ performance evaluation
  object, which has the following properties: `measure`,
  `measurement`, `per_fold`, `per_observation`,
  `fitted_params_per_fold`, `report_per_fold` (here there is only one
  fold). For further details, see [Evaluating Model Performance](@ref).


### The training algorithm

Here now is a simplified description of the training of an
`IteratedModel`. First, the atomic `model` is bound in a machine - the
*training machine* above - to a subset of the supplied data, and then
wrapped in an object called `wrapper` below. To train the training
machine machine for `i` more iterations, and update the other data in
the wrapper, requires the call `MLJIteration.train!(wrapper, i)`. Only
controls can make this call (e.g., `Step(...)`, or
`IterateFromList(...)` above). If we assume for simplicity there is
only a single control, called `control`, then training proceeds as
follows:

```julia
n = 1 # initialize control cycle counter
state = update!(control, wrapper, verbosity, n)
finished = done(control, state)

# subsequent training events:
while !finished
    n += 1
    state = update!(control, wrapper, verbosity, n, state)
    finished = done(control, state)
end

# finalization:
return takedown(control, verbosity, state)
```


### Example 2 - Cyclic learning rates

The control below implements a triangular cyclic learning rate policy,
close to that described in [L. N. Smith
(2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7926641): "Cyclical
Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks," 2017 IEEE Winter
Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Santa Rosa, CA,
USA, pp. 464-472. [In that paper learning rates are mutated (slowly)
*during* each training iteration (epoch) while here mutations can occur
once per iteration of the model, at most.]

For the sake of illustration, we suppose the iterative model, `model`,
specified in the `IteratedModel` constructor, has a field called
`:learning_parameter`, and that mutating this parameter does not
trigger cold-restarts.

```julia
struct CycleLearningRate{F<:AbstractFloat}
    stepsize::Int
    lower::F
    upper::F
end

# return one cycle of learning rate values:
function one_cycle(c::CycleLearningRate)
    rise = range(c.lower, c.upper, length=c.stepsize + 1)
    fall = reverse(rise)
    return vcat(rise[1:end - 1], fall[1:end - 1])
end

function IterationControl.update!(control::CycleLearningRate,
                                  wrapper,
                                  verbosity,
                                  n,
                                  state = (learning_rates=nothing, ))
    rates = n == 0 ? one_cycle(control) : state.learning_rates
    index = mod(n, length(rates)) + 1
    r = rates[index]
    verbosity > 1 && @info "learning rate: $r"
    wrapper.model.iteration_control = r
    return (learning_rates = rates,)
end
```
