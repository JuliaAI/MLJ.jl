# Loading Model Code

Once the name of a model, and the package providing that model, have
been identified (see [Model Search](@ref model_search)) one can either
import the model type interactively with `@iload`, as shown under
[Installation](@ref), or use `@load` as shown below. The `@load` macro
works from within a module, a package or a function, provided the
relevant package providing the MLJ interface has been added to your
package environment.

In general, the code providing core functionality for the model
(living in a packge you should consult for documentation) may be
different from the package providing the MLJ interface. Since the core
package is a dependency of the interface package, only the interface
package needs to be added to your environment.

For instance, suppose you have activated a Julia package environment
`my_env` that you wish to use for your MLJ project; for example you
have run:


```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("my_env", shared=true)
```

And, furthermore, suppose you want to use `DecisionTreeClassifier`,
provided by the
[DecisionTree.jl](https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl)
package. Then, to determine which package provides the MLJ interface
you call `load_path`:

```julia
julia> load_path("DecisionTreeClassifier", pkg="DecisionTree")
"MLJDecisionTreeInterface.DecisionTreeClassifier"
```

In this case we see that the package required is
MLJDecisionTreeInterface.jl. If this package is not in `my_env` (do
`Pkg.status()` to check) you add it by running

```julia
julia> Pkg.add("MLJDecisionTreeInterface");
```

So long as `my_env` is the active environment, this action need never
be repeated (unless you run `Pkg.rm("MLJDecisionTreeInterface")`). You
are now ready to instantiate a decision tree classifier:

```julia
julia> Tree = @load DecisionTree pkg=DecisionTree
julia> tree = Tree()
```

which is equivalent to

```julia
julia> import MLJDecisionTreeInterface.DecisionTreeClassifier
julia> Tree = MLJDecisionTreeInterface.DecisionTreeClassifier()
julia> tree = Tree()
```

*Tip.* The specification `pkg=...` above can be dropped for the many
models that are provided by only a single package.
