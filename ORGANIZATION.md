*Dependency chart for MLJ repositories. Repositories with dashed
connections do not currently exist but are planned/proposed.*

Repositories of some possible interest outside of MLJ, or beyond
its conventional use, are marked with a ⟂ symbol:

* [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) is the
  general user's point-of-entry for choosing, loading, composing,
  evaluating and tuning machine learning models. It pulls in most code
  from other repositories described below.  MLJ also hosts the [MLJ
  manual](src/docs) which documents functionality across the
  repositories, with the exception of ScientificTypesBase, and
  MLJScientific types which host their own documentation. (The MLJ
  manual and MLJTutorials do provide overviews of scientific types.)

* [MLJModelInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModelInterface.jl)
  is a lightweight package imported by packages implementing MLJ's
  interface for their machine learning models. It's only dependencies
  are ScientificTypesBase.jl (which depends only on the standard
  library module `Random`) and
  [StatisticalTraits.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/StatisticalTraits.jl)
  (which depends only on ScientificTypesBase.jl).

* (⟂)
  [MLJBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl) is
  a large repository with two main purposes: (i) to give "dummy"
  methods defined in MLJModelInterface their intended functionality
  (which depends on third party packages, such as
  [Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl),
  [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)
  and
  [CategoricalArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CategoricalArrays.jl));
  and (ii) provide functionality essential to the MLJ user that has
  not been relegated to its own "satellite" repository for some
  reason. See the [MLJBase.jl
  readme](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJBase.jl) for a
  detailed description of MLJBase's contents.

* [MLJModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJModels.jl)
  hosts the *MLJ model registry*, which contains metadata on all the
  models the MLJ user can search and load from MLJ. Moreover, it
  provides the functionality for **loading model code** from MLJ on
  demand. Finally, it furnishes some commonly used transformers for
  data pre-processing, such as `ContinuousEncoder` and `Standardizer`.

* [MLJTuning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJTuning.jl)
  provides MLJ's `TunedModel` wrapper for hyper-parameter
  optimization, including the extendable API for tuning strategies,
  and selected in-house implementations, such as `Grid` and
  `RandomSearch`.
  
* [MLJEnsembles.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJEnsembles.jl)
  provides MLJ's `EnsembleModel` wrapper, for creating homogenous
  model ensembles.
  
* [MLJIteration.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJIteration.jl)
  provides the `IteratedModel` wrapper for controlling iterative
  models (snapshots, early stopping criteria, etc)
  
* [MLJSerialization.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJSerialization.jl)
  provides functionality for saving MLJ machines to file
  
* [MLJOpenML.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJOpenML.jl) provides
  integration with the [OpenML](https://www.openml.org) data science
  exchange platform
  
* (⟂)
  [MLJLinearModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJLinearModels.jl)
  is an experimental package for a wide range of julia-native penalized linear models
  such as Lasso, Elastic-Net, Robust regression, LAD regression,
  etc. 

* [MLJFlux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLJFlux.jl) an experimental
  package for gradient-descent models, such as traditional
  neural-networks, built with
  [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl), in MLJ.
  
* (⟂)
  [ScientificTypesBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/ScientificTypesBase.jl)
  is an ultra lightweight package providing "scientific" types,
  such as `Continuous`, `OrderedFactor`, `Image` and `Table`. It's
  purpose is to formalize conventions around the scientific
  interpretation of ordinary machine types, such as `Float32` and
  `DataFrame`.
  
* (⟂)
  [ScientificTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/ScientificTypes.jl)
  articulates MLJ's own convention for the scientific interpretation of
  data.
  
* (⟂)
  [StatisticalTraits.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/StatisticalTraits.jl)
  An ultra lightweight package defining fall-back implementations for
  a collection of traits possessed by statistical objects.

* (⟂)
  [DataScienceTutorials](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DataScienceTutorials.jl)
  collects tutorials on how to use MLJ, which are deployed
  [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/)
